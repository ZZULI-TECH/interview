# JVM

The Java Virtual Machine is the cornerstone of the Java platform. It is the
component of the technology responsible for its hardware- and operating systemindependence,
the small size of its compiled code, and its ability to protect users
from malicious programs.

The Java Virtual Machine is an abstract computing machine. Like a real computing
machine, it has an instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at run time.
It is reasonably common to implement a programming language using a virtual
machine; the best-known virtual machine may be the P-Code machine of UCSD
Pascal.
